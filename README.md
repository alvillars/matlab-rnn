### My Matlab implementation of some recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as follows
* Vanilla RNN 
* Gated Recurrent Unit ([GRU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078)) 
* Long Short-Term Memory ([LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5778)) 
* Multiplicative Integration RNN ([MIRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06630)) 
* Control Gate based RNN ([CGRNN](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2964284.2967249))
* Self-Gated RNN ([SGRNN](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3126686.3126764))
